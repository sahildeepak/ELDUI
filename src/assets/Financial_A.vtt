00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.685
For my mom in particular, she had the ability to

NOTE Confidence: 0.9188

00:00:26.742 --> 00:00:28.400
hear music just a little bit,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9437

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.790
but she could never understand.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7137

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.960
What? The words were for songs in this net,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8035

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.040
so I used to paraphrase the songs for her.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8879

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.511
Try to tell her what they were about and she

NOTE Confidence: 0.8879

00:00:38.568 --> 00:00:41.320
said everyone can kind of read each others minds.

NOTE Confidence: 0.928

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.060
I don't have that ability.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8887

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.990
Both of my parents were born here.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7682

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.070
My mother at around two years old got

NOTE Confidence: 0.732

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.667
rheumatic fever. And she lost about 80%

NOTE Confidence: 0.849

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.400
of her hearing my father and around six years old.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5595

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.080
Lost

NOTE Confidence: 0.882

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:07.890
about 60% of his hearing from.

NOTE Confidence: 0.5525

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.681
Section is here so. They grew up,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8575

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.637
yeah, and their first language was signed so growing up

NOTE Confidence: 0.8575

00:01:16.707 --> 00:01:16.848
I,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8587

00:01:16.902 --> 00:01:20.250
you know, quickly learned sign language and how to communicate.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8922

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.850
One day a person came to the office who was

NOTE Confidence: 0.8922

00:01:30.921 --> 00:01:35.277
deaf and they were trying to communicate with their financial

NOTE Confidence: 0.8922

00:01:35.348 --> 00:01:37.490
advisor and I started signing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7387

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.790
And it was amazing. This person was like,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8452

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.640
you know, sign.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7172

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:54.430
Within one

NOTE Confidence: 0.9553

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.540
or two weeks after that meeting.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8834

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.520
10 or 12 new clients came to the office.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9332

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.100
They showed up in my office without an appointment.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9477

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.200
Just said I want to talk with James.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9303

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.356
I prefer to have that face to face interaction as

NOTE Confidence: 0.9303

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:22.250
much as I possibly can.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9416

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:23.810
If they don't want to come and meet with me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.94

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.650
If it's too far of a trip,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8523

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.590
I'll make the trip to go see them to me.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9125

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.812
I've you part of my job is to do the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9125

00:02:29.874 --> 00:02:32.590
best I can to help people have access to the

NOTE Confidence: 0.9125

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:36.046
same level of service and professionalism that hearing.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7306

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.064
Will get the term. CODA stands for a child of

NOTE Confidence: 0.7306

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.920
deaf adults.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9082

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.238
What that's referring to is someone who's grown up in

NOTE Confidence: 0.9082

00:02:43.301 --> 00:02:46.870
a household of deaf people and understands deaf cultures,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9124

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.500
but they themselves are not deaf.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8724

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.441
It's hard for me not to view every one of

NOTE Confidence: 0.8724

00:02:51.512 --> 00:02:52.660
my deaf clients.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7161

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:53.630
Like my parents.
