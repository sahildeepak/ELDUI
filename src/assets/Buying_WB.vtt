NOTE Confidence: 0.842

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.290
I think everybody had as much fun as ever.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.205
I mean, we we we had a crowd that certainly

NOTE Confidence: 0.9144

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:08.390
equaled our record and.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8563

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:12.180
Again, running into thousands of shareholders and they're there.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8535

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.427
They're all having a good time here and our directors

NOTE Confidence: 0.8535

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:15.190
have a good time.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9515

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.860
So it's it's just sort of.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9178

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.590
A Mardi Gras.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9115

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.710
Was there anything different about this meeting or is it

NOTE Confidence: 0.9115

00:00:20.758 --> 00:00:22.590
the sameness that makes it so special?

NOTE Confidence: 0.8705

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.950
It's the

NOTE Confidence: 0.8205

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.280
sameness pretty much, I mean that working with Charlie Munger.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8066

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.112
We're not going to change the format very much,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9468

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:32.070
although

NOTE Confidence: 0.9186

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.925
Brian pointed out earlier that there were a lot of

NOTE Confidence: 0.9186

00:00:34.981 --> 00:00:36.720
kind of controversial subjects,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9421

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.913
a lot of things that caught people's attention and picked

NOTE Confidence: 0.9421

00:00:38.951 --> 00:00:39.990
up a lot of news this time,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8852

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.340
and it's because you and Charlie say what you think,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8487

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:43.100
especially Charlie.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7522

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.014
Yeah yeah, Charlie says exactly what he thinks and he

NOTE Confidence: 0.7522

00:00:48.076 --> 00:00:51.917
thinks that colorful language to have you noticed I've noticed

NOTE Confidence: 0.7522

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:53.590
that has that changed over

NOTE Confidence: 0.7251

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.660
the years or is that just more that Charlie?

NOTE Confidence: 0.7659

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.480
Yeah, that's Charlie. And since you met him

NOTE Confidence: 0.5501

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:58.040
since

NOTE Confidence: 0.8862

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.530
1959 when I met him,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7535

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.980
OK, Warren, let's talk

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.513
about some of the things that really resonated with people

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835

00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:05.949
and maybe start where you began the annual meeting this

NOTE Confidence: 0.8835

00:01:05.992 --> 00:01:06.210
year.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9028

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.575
And that was talking to your investors and telling them

NOTE Confidence: 0.9028

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.410
a little bit about investing,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9472

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.890
some tips and lessons along the way.

NOTE Confidence: 0.915

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.009
You kind of used as a teaching experience at the

NOTE Confidence: 0.915

00:01:15.053 --> 00:01:15.230
top.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9464

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.440
Yeah, normally I don't do that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.655
I mean that in fact I can't remember when I

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824

00:01:19.707 --> 00:01:22.076
did it the we just go right into questions and

NOTE Confidence: 0.8824

00:01:22.128 --> 00:01:22.540
answers,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9701

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.420
but I really thought that.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.788
That maybe you were giving a little bit the wrong

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676

00:01:28.857 --> 00:01:33.530
lesson because all the questions would naturally tend toward current

NOTE Confidence: 0.8676

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:34.080
events,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9624

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.040
and so this time I went back.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8732

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.893
Actually didn't 1942 when I bought my first stock as

NOTE Confidence: 0.8732

00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:46.264
an illustration of all the things that have happened since

NOTE Confidence: 0.8732

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:46.709
1942,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8042

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.500
we've had we've had 14 Presidents,

NOTE Confidence: 0.7888

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.240
7 Republicans, 7 Democrats we've had.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9192

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.220
We've had world wars, we had 911.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8943

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.990
We had the Cuban missile crisis we have.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7509

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.850
We're all kinds of things.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9411

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.310
The best single thing you could have done.

NOTE Confidence: 0.882

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.930
On March 11th, 1942, when I bought my first stock,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8482

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.394
which just buy an index fund and and and never

NOTE Confidence: 0.8482

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:09.900
look at a headline.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8536

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.130
Never think about stocks anymore,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9167

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.650
just like you would do if you bought a farm.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8918

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.550
You just buy the farm,

NOTE Confidence: 0.6984

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.490
let the let the tenant farmer bought it for you,

NOTE Confidence: 0.937

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.874
and I pointed out that if you'd put $10,000 in

NOTE Confidence: 0.937

00:02:19.947 --> 00:02:22.890
an index fund that reinvested dividends,

NOTE Confidence: 0.9056

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.184
and I paused for a moment to let the audience

NOTE Confidence: 0.9056

00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:27.070
try and guess how much it amount to.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8947

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.850
And it would come to $51 million now.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9413

00:02:29.925 --> 00:02:33.115
And the only thing you had to really believe in

NOTE Confidence: 0.9413

00:02:33.183 --> 00:02:35.830
then is that America would win the war,

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.990
and that America would progress as it has ever since

NOTE Confidence: 0.8962

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.630
1776 and that American business.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7232

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.030
If America moved forward, American business would move forward.

NOTE Confidence: 0.8815

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.030
You didn't have to worry about what stock to buy.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9072

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.008
It didn't have to worry what day to get in

NOTE Confidence: 0.9072

00:02:50.055 --> 00:02:50.950
and out you didn't.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9117

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.080
You didn't know the Federal Reserve would exist.

NOTE Confidence: 0.7797

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.870
You know whatever it might be.

NOTE Confidence: 0.764

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.530
And America works.

NOTE Confidence: 0.9788
